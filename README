ButtonMaker is a simple iPhone / iPad App which should be run on the Simulator Only.  It uses undocumented APIs to create UIGlassButtons and UINavigationButtons with various styles, and then saves the images for the button, and its selected equivalent in the application's documents directory.  Handy when you need to make nice buttons.
